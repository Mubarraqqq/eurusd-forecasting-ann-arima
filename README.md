# 📈 EUR/USD Forex Rate Forecasting Using ANN & ARIMA

A comparative implementation of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** for predicting EUR/USD hourly exchange rate trends. This project aligns with the research paper [_"A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for USD/EUR Foreign Exchange Rate Forecasting"_](https://www.irejournals.com/formatedpaper/1706704.pdf) authored by Mubaraq Onipede and team at the National Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Nigeria.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The foreign exchange (Forex) market is notoriously volatile and non-linear. This project investigates two powerful approaches for trend forecasting:

- **ARIMA**: a classical statistical model for identifying and extrapolating linear trends.
- **ANN**: a deep learning model designed to capture complex, non-linear patterns in sequential financial data.

The dataset consists of **hourly EUR/USD exchange rate data** sourced from **MetaTrader 5**, covering **January 2013 – September 2016**.

## 🔍 Research Objectives

- Forecast hourly EUR/USD trends using supervised learning.
- Compare ANN and ARIMA based on their predictive performance.
- Explore how technical indicators enhance financial time series forecasting.
- Evaluate models using metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Accuracy**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:
This analysis was limited by computational constraints, allowing only 8 features to be used out of a potential 122 that could be derived through domain knowledge and advanced feature engineering. As such, the model lacks the complexity and generalization required for real-world deployment. This study is strictly for educational purposes and should not be used for commercial decisions.
